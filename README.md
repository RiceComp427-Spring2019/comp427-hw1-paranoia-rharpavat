## Rational Paranoia
The homework specifications, as well as the corresponding course slide decks,
can be found on the [Comp427 Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/jqifhp864b37ju).
This assignment is due **Thursday, January 17 at 6 p.m.**

You will do this homework by editing the _README.md_ file. It's in
[MarkDown format](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
and will be rendered to beautiful HTML when you visit your GitHub repo.

## Student Information
Please also edit _README.md_ and replace your instructor's name and NetID with your own:

_Student name_: Rishu Harpavat

_Student NetID_: rh34

Your NetID is typically your initials and a numeric digit. That's
what we need here.

_If you contacted us in advance and we approved a late submission,
please cut-and-paste the text from that email here._

## Problem 1
- Scenario: Stadium
- Assumptions:
  - Since we're the overseer(s) of the stadium, we have full control over all aspects of said stadium, including:
    * Access to restricted areas (locker rooms, VIP boxes, etc.)
    * Electronic hardware and data storing information about the team
  - We need to protect the stadium from physical damage as well as the team and/or any university officials from harm (while they are inside the stadium)
- Assets:
  - Restricted areas (locker rooms, VIP boxes, etc.): We need to protect the team as well as any visiting university officials from harm.
  - Confidential data: The stadium's systems might contain confidential data about things such as:
    * Player information (health, contact, etc.)
    * Team information (itineraries, play analysis, playbooks, etc.)
  - Stadium property: The stadium might be storing expensive training equipment, players' belongings, and other valuables; we'd want to protect these from theft.
  - The people involved - players, coaches, and university officials
- Threats:
  - Spies from competing schools: Rival schools may send spies in to infiltrate the stadium in order to:
    * obtain valuable team/player information that would allow them to anticipate their play strategy
    * sabotage the team in some manner (physically harm a player and render them unable to play subsequent games)
  - Overzealous fans: They might try and find players in locker rooms to get autographs and _accidentally_ walk away with personal belongings
- Countermeasures:
  - Biometric scanners controlling access to restricted areas (given that this is one of the top football teams in the nation, they probably generate enough revenue that we can afford this investment)
  - Strong encryption on any confidential data, as well as strong login credentials for accessing the machine the data is stored on to begin with
